# Wellington Rivals of Aether Stream Overlay for TSH

Place scoreboard_wellyRoA into TSH's `layout` folder and you're good to go.

Updated for TSH v5.8
Eyesight config should be all fine.

Supports Rivals 2 characters, but it might not look as good with the Rivals 2 UI. Make sure you have the character _renders_ asset pack downloaded.

Feel free to message me on discord (@Gullgum) if you have questions/issues!
