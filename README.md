# Wellington Rivals of Aether Stream Overlay for TSH

Place scoreboard_wellyRoA into TSH's `layout` folder and you're good to go.

Updated for TSH v5.8
Eyesight config should be all fine.

Can also work for Rivals 2 but I will probably make a modified version later for that. I have not done any config for Rivals 2 so eyesights are probably going to be a little wack.

Feel free to message me on discord (@Gullgum) if you have questions/issues!
