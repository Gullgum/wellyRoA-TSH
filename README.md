# Wellington Rivals of Aether Stream Overlay for TSH

Includes overlays for Rivals 1 and Rivals 2!

Place scoreboard_wellyRoA into TSH's `layout` folder and you're good to go.
Use the 'online' variants to hide the top bars that appear in the game during online or tourney mode matches.

Updated for TSH v5.8
Eyesight config should be all fine.

Feel free to message me on discord (@Gullgum) if you have questions/issues!
